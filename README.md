# Taxi-Cancellations---A-Predictive-Model-Analysis
This project compares multiple types of statistical and machine learning models to predict taxi cancellations. 
The model is coded in R. The dataset (like many real-world datasets) was highly imbalanced, and much of the performance of all models hinged on adapting the models to this imbalance. 
Models:
  Logistic Regression (Penalized / Non-Penalized) \n
  Decision Tree Model;
  XGBoost
  Artifical Neural Network
  Ensemble Model
